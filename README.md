# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election

1. Calculate total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total numbers of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the precentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine winner of election based on popular vote

## Resources
* Data Source: election.results.csv
* software: Python 3.6.7. Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Challange overview
This code can be utilized for many different purposes in future election analyses. We can alter the code to evaluate at county, city or state level by simply changing out input date and creating new variables for corresponding desired target region. In a national election, changing the County level statistics to State level statitics will allow us to see how votes fall out state by state to understand the popular vote vs. Electoral College. This code can be used in a multitude of ways with slight modifications --this will save a lot of time for large datasets.
